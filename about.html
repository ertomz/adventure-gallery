                <p>
                    One of the main reasons I wanted to get a phone was for Instagram. I was 13 years old and wanted to be part of the social scene at school.
                    But, as the years went by, I constantly found myself contemplating which photo to post, which caption to use, and what people would think.
                    At a certain point, I stopped posting as frequently, maybe three to four times per year. But, some would say that a lot of the things I do
                    and places I go are 'post-worthy'. But I don't like that. I don't like that there even is a concept of 'post-worthy', something that is somewhat
                    'worthy' of being seen by my so-called social media 'friends'. As I've grown up and become more aware of the virtues and faults of social media,
                    I rarely find it worth my time to post. It seems like a disservice to these moments to get their approval by those who I rarely see
                    and talk to, especially nowadays. I'd rather let them be. Let them stay those moments, my little secrets with the earth. This page was not created
                    with the purpose of obtaining approval of these adventures. It was made with the hope of envoking joy and gratitude amongst myself and others.
                    These adventures deserve that, at the least. I have an interesting relationship with taking photos. I love capturing moments so I can remember them
                    after they're nearly gone from memory, but I also love letting them wander free. Free to be remembered or forgotten. Free to simply be.
                    The photos from these adventures are ones I'm happy I took. They were taken because the moment was right, and because I wanted to remember them, not
                    because they would 'look good on my feed' or anything like that.
